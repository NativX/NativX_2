let sean  = "This book is a testament to the power of the growth-mindset versus the fixed-mindset. Dweck explains the power of the growth mindset through countless examples of the most accomplished athletes, students, teachers and parents, but also showcases the negative effects of the fixed-mindset in even the most naturally talented individuals. Dweck does a very good job of giving a wide range of examples to ultimately make her claim about the growth mindset. She shows how the most “untalented” students were able to recite Shakespeare after obtaining the growth-mindset from a motivated teacher. She then shows how “talented” athletes like Michael Jordon were able to “stay on top” by never settling and always learning, while “talented” but fixed-minded athletes stood around while others surpassed them. This book can help me a lot in life. I started to read a little of this book every morning because I found myself more motivated to get better during that day. I think my parents have religiously taught me the theme in Mindset of hard work and constant individual bettering throughout my life; something I am very grateful for. But there were many small aspects of the growth-mindset/fixed-mindset that I had not thought about. For example, I find myself falling into the “all or nothing” category that sometimes does not allow me to learn from my failures and mistakes. A lot of times when I get tests or psets back I just check to see what answers I got right and wrong and then move on. I think I could learn a lot from my mistakes if I went back and studied where I went wrong. I can use this book as a constant reminder that college is about learning. I also find myself in the “all or nothing” category in sports; something I am still not ready to give up but to change slightly. When we lose or I play poorly, instead of avoiding the film I will now go back and try to figure out why I made the mistakes I did and what we as a team can do to improve.I think that this book can help our season by reminding us that we need to take every day as an opportunity to get better. Instead of just reciting our ideas of “if everyone on the team was doing what I was doing, where would our team be?” we need to actually ask ourselves this every day. If we all buy in to the growth-mindset then individually we will all get better, making the team better along the way. I think this was a good book for our urgency coming into the season. I think this book can help our program academically and socially. Academically we, as a team, should start challenging ourselves in the classroom in the fall when we have the time. Socially, I think that a lot of us came from a Highschool where we were automatically “cool” because we were good at sports. By using the growth-mindset, we can grow as people by having conversations we normally do not have with people we normally do not talk to."
